# snake-game
 This is a basic snake game using python's pygame package. The game consists of a player snake and three a.i. controlled snakes all going after the same point objects.
 
 To play the game, simply run dist/new_game.exe. All of the code for the project can be seen in new_game.py with comments explaining each process.
